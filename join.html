					The West Chester University Pharmaceutical Product Development Club is proudly pushing the boundaries on what it means to be a West Chester University student. Open to all majors, we host a variety of events that help us build a welcoming and inclusive community of motivated students interested in the pharmaceutical industry at West Chester University. Our goal is to help create an engaging atmosphere to meet other students, learn more about the field of pharmaceuticals, and develop professionally.
